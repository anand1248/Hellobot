# Hellobot

Hellobot is a simple chatbot which echoes the users messages to the user itself. This is just a basic version of this bot subsequently more features and improvements will be added at a later stage.

This bot is purely based on **python** and is implemented on **Telegram** as it provides an excellent platform for creation of user controlled bots. I haven't yet released the documentation because this bot works on a single unique key *(HTTP API TOKEN)* as of now but after I complete this project I will provide the whole documentation. 

### As mentioned earlier more features coming soon!
